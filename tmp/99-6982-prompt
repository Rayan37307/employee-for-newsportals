You have been given a function change.
Create the contents of the function.
If the function already contains contents, use those as context
Check the contents of the file you are in for any helper functions or context
Your response should be the complete function, including signature

<Example>
<Input>
export function fizz_buzz(count: number): void {
}
</Input>
<Output>
function fizz_buzz(count: number): void {
  for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log("Fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("Buzz");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
</Output>
<Notes>
* notice that the output did not include the export statement
* only return the function
</Notes>
</Example>


if there are DIRECTIONS, follow those when changing this function.  Do not deviate

<FunctionText>function testAuthSystem() {

<MustObey>
NEVER alter any file other than TEMP_FILE.
never provide the requested changes as conversational output. Return only the code.
ONLY provide requested changes by writing the change to TEMP_FILE

never attempt to read TEMP_FILE.  It is purely for output.  Previous contents, which may not exist, can be written over without worry

<TEMP_FILE>/home/rayan/coding/news-agent/tmp/99-6982</TEMP_FILE>
